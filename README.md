# Quilt

To run the program, on command line enter "python3 Quilt.py < testfile.txt", inserting
your testfile name. The resulting image ("curr.png") should appear in your current directory. 

This program uses a Breadth-First implementation to draw the squares. 

The program should base the side lengths (and therefore the scale of each new rectangle) off of the first rectangle.
